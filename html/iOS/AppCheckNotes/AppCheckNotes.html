            We have started the review of your app, but we are not able to continue because we need additional
            information about your app.<br><br>

            Next Steps<br><br>

            To help us proceed with the review of your app, please provide detailed information to the following
            questions. The more information you can provide upfront, the sooner we can complete your review.<br><br>

            1. Who are the targeted audiences? <br>
            2. Is this app only for internal use? <br>
            3. Is this app for a specific company or for many other companies? <br>
            4. How do users receive a username / password? <br><br>

            Once you reply to this message in Resolution Center with the requested information, we can proceed with your
            review.<br><br>

            Your app uses background location services but does not clarify the purpose of its use in the location modal
            alert as required in the iOS Human Interface Guidelines.<br><br>

            Please see attached screenshots for details.<br><br>

            Next Steps<br><br>

            To resolve this issue, please revise the NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription value in the Info.plist to specify
            the intended purpose of using the user's location while the app is in the background.<br><br>

            Resources<br><br>

            For additional information and instructions on configuring and presenting an alert, please review
            the Requesting Permission section of the iOS Human Interface Guidelines and the Information Property List

            Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed<br><br>


            We have started the review of your app, but we are not able to continue because we need access to a video
            that demonstrates your app in use with the background location mode on a physical iOS device.<br><br>

            Please ensure the video you provide shows a physical iOS device (not a simulator).<br><br>

            Next Steps<br><br>

            To help us proceed with the review of your app, please provide us with a link to a demo video in the App
            Review Information section of iTunes Connect and reply to this message in Resolution Center.<br><br>

            To provide a link to a demo video:<br><br>

            - Log in to iTunes Connect<br>
            - Click on "My Apps"<br>
            - Select your app<br>
            - Click on the app version on the left side of the screen<br>
            - Scroll down to "App Review Information"<br>
            - Provide demo video access details in the "Notes" section<br>
            - Click "Save"<br>
            - Once you've completed all changes, click the "Submit for Review" button at the top of the App Version
            Information page.<br><br>

            Once this information is available, we can continue with the review of your app.<br><br>

            Guideline 2.5.2 - Performance - Software Requirements<br><br><br>


            In addition, your app, extension, or linked framework appears to contain code designed explicitly with the
            capability to change your app’s behavior or functionality after App Review approval, which is not in
            compliance with App Store Review Guideline 2.5.2 and section 3.3.2 of the Apple Developer Program License
            Agreement.<br><br>

            This code, combined with a remote resource, can facilitate significant changes to your app’s behavior
            compared to when it was initially reviewed for the App Store. While you may not be using this functionality
            currently, it has the potential to load private frameworks, private methods, and enable future feature
            changes. This includes any code which passes arbitrary parameters to dynamic methods such as dlopen(),
            dlsym(), respondsToSelector:, performSelector:, method_exchangeImplementations(), and running remote scripts
            in order to change app behavior and/or call SPI, based on the contents of the downloaded script. Even if the
            remote resource is not intentionally malicious, it could easily be hijacked via a Man In The Middle (MiTM)
            attack, which can pose a serious security vulnerability to users of your app.<br><br>

            The next submission of this app may require a longer review time.<br><br>

            Next Steps<br><br>

            - Review the Software Requirements section of the App Store Review Guidelines.<br>
            - Ensure your app is compliant with all sections of the App Store Review Guidelines and the Terms &
            Conditions of the Apple Developer Program. <br>
            - Once your app is fully compliant, resubmit your app for review.<br><br>

            Submitting apps designed to mislead or harm customers or evade the review process may result in the
            termination of your Apple Developer Program account. Review the Terms & Conditions of the Apple Developer
            Program to learn more about our policies regarding termination.<br><br>

            If you believe your app is compliant with the App Store Review Guidelines, you may submit an appeal.
            Alternatively, you may provide additional details about your app by replying directly to this
            message.<br><br>
